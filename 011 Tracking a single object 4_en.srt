00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:07,860
Hello and welcome to this lecture, where we are going to perform tests using all algorithms and compare

2
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:08,610
to results.

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:16,079
First, let's test the boosting algorithms as you learn in the lectures.

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,140
This is one of the simplest algorithms.

5
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:21,960
So the results are not so good.

6
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:28,800
Let's select the object we want should track breasts and there.

7
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:38,180
We can see that after only some seconds, the balding box is outside the objects.

8
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:41,270
In other words, we have that problem.

9
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:48,770
That's the algorithm loses the object, so it has its good results in this video.

10
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:58,070
Let's move on to the next algorithm, which is MDL, the one we tested last lecture.

11
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:09,320
Let's select your runner press and there we can see that it is bad there then boasting it can drag the

12
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,100
object.

13
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:19,160
But there is a problem, as we saw last lecture that after some frames, it loses the objects and it's

14
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,930
since it is tracking.

15
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:31,250
That's either runner and lots, the one which selects Let's try c f no to run this code.

16
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:36,410
Let's select the objects press.

17
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:44,960
And there we can see that it is a very fast algorithm according to what you learn in the two lectures,

18
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:52,640
and it has good results badder than boasting and mew in this type of video.

19
00:01:53,330 --> 00:02:06,470
Let's move on to the next one, which is state run this code select the object press and there you can

20
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:09,139
see this message tracking failure.

21
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:19,160
And the algorithm couldn't drag the object, it lose the object at the beginning, and you can see here

22
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,320
some other building blocks.

23
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:29,860
The algorithm has into good results and we can take a look at the of the ear that's massaged.

24
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:37,640
Tracking failure is shown when the algorithm who then generates the building blocks.

25
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:49,040
You could see that after some time, some other building blocks are generated at the video, which indicates

26
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:56,060
that the building blocks was updated but not in the correct location.

27
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:04,580
In this execution, here we can see that the algorithm wasn't able to generate any building blocks,

28
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:10,190
so it has terrible results considering this case is 30.

29
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:19,610
The interesting points about knowing the basic intuition about these algorithms is that you can know

30
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:22,880
better the way each one behave.

31
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:31,820
So you'll need to look past them all in order to choose the best one according to your type of application.

32
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:40,580
Maybe in this scenario, the L.D has terrible results, but in this scenario that you are working,

33
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:43,430
it may be the best results.

34
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,850
So it's a matter of testing the algorithms.

35
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:52,760
Now let's move on to the next one, which is median flow.

36
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:57,440
Let's create the building blocks.

37
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:58,480
Press and.

38
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:08,780
We can see that it has in good results again tracking failure and some other bounding boxes were generated

39
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:11,090
outside the objects.

40
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:21,230
Let's try to define and order building blocks a smaller building blocks a year press and there.

41
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,370
No improvements in the results using this algorithm.

42
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:29,610
You can see that it is a fast algorithm.

43
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:41,040
Now let's move on to the next one, which is the muse algorithm selects the runner press and third.

44
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:48,190
We couldn't even generate the building blocks in the first frames of the video.

45
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:51,310
We got the message tracking failure.

46
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:54,160
Let's try another test.

47
00:04:54,580 --> 00:05:01,300
For example, selecting a smaller building box presenter.

48
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:12,690
We can see that the body box was generated, but this video is too fast for this algorithm, so we want

49
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:14,490
to get good results.

50
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:25,170
And finally, let's perform the test using the best algorithm of all these ones here the c s r d.

51
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:29,910
Let's select the runner press.

52
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:39,930
And there you can see that it is a lower algorithm if compares to the others, but we can see that it

53
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:44,100
can track the drug runner until the end of the video.

54
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:53,890
Let's change again, should the milk algorithm and the farm at the last test.

55
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:59,830
I will try to track only the heads of this person here.

56
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:03,170
Press and there we cannot track.

57
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:07,870
The algorithm wasn't able and we can see the message tracking failure.

58
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:09,700
Let's change again.

59
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:12,060
See as our team.

60
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,970
Let's select the hands.

61
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:23,020
And in this part two here, even when the heads were very close.

62
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:31,300
The algorithm could correctly track this heads here, so it has very good results.

63
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:40,270
And again, when you are developing your own application, I encourage you to test all the algorithms

64
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:48,340
so you can choose the best one according to the type of application you are developing, and they encourage

65
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:55,060
you to download author videos and try to pass these algorithms.

66
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:06,040
And the next lecture, we will implement mode tracking, so we'll be able to select more than one object

67
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,020
should track in this same video.

68
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,130
See you there!
