Hello and welcome to this lecture, where you are going to learn the basic intuition about another type

2
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:14,280
of the optical flow algorithm, which is the dance, as you can read, the here.

3
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:19,500
The one you learned before was the optical flow sparse.

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:27,960
All mathematical concepts and calculations, especially the concept of pyramids, are the same.

5
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:31,140
And we will only see what is different.

6
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:41,970
The main difference is that sparse optical flow detects the coroner's only in the first frame, while

7
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:44,700
dance uses the full image.

8
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:54,630
Therefore, it is is a lower birth generally gives bad results in shards in this bar's algorithm.

9
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:59,130
The coroners are detected only in the initial frame.

10
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:08,550
And these same iguanas are used during the entire is it crucial, while in the dance algorithm, the

11
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:12,150
coroners are detected frame by frame.

12
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:21,450
There are several ways to implement this algorithm, and the one that's OpenSea uses is the fender back

13
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:28,860
methods, which uses a linear algebra concept called polynomial expansion.

14
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:37,230
We will see more detail about this name here in the implementations to understand the differences between

15
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:40,510
the two techniques spires and dance.

16
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:51,480
We can look at this image on the left is espoirs, and on your right is dance as we can see and implement

17
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:59,550
it before spa's gets a few pixels that represent the edges and the corners of the image.

18
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:10,050
And then it is possible to draw a line that indicates the path of the object, which is nothing more

19
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:19,260
than tracking something that is that's generally the object is not selected on the order of hands.

20
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:30,630
The dance algorithm lets you select the entire object, as you can see here is possible to see the shape

21
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:31,110
of the.

22
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,050
Earlier, I command the.

23
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:41,060
It's that the quality could be bad there, and we can see that this pass cannot drag.

24
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:43,710
Could this yellow car here?

25
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:53,550
Whereas the dance algorithm can, as you can see here, where I am pointing the mouse Big Color is more

26
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:57,570
intense for objects close to the camera.

27
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:07,140
For example, for this car here and less in bands for objects fired from the camera here on the bridge.

28
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:13,020
If the object is not moving, it is not detected.

29
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:21,060
This bar's algorithm is tracking here the edge of the roads on the order of hands.

30
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:28,740
Here, the image is black, indicating that the edge of the road will not be tracked.

31
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,870
And that's all for the basic differences between the algorithms.

32
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:40,050
In the next lecture, we are going to implemented using open SIFI sealed air.
