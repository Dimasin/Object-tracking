00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:06,860
Hello and welcome to this lecture, where you were going to learn the basic intuition about another

2
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:15,090
algorithm, which is optical flow, which considers the direction and speeds off peak cells.

3
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:24,450
It is similar to the motion model you learn in the first lectures that indicate where the object will

4
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:26,130
be in the next frame.

5
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:31,880
It considers location blue's speed and previous frames.

6
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:41,760
For example, the farther the car is from the camera, the smaller the movement of the pixels is because

7
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,800
as the image is smaller, there are less pixels in the image.

8
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:56,580
If the car is here at the ends of the image where I am pointing the mouse, its size will be much smaller

9
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,750
and the amount of pixels will also be smaller.

10
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:08,310
In other words, when the size of the car is smaller, that are fewer pixels to track.

11
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:17,940
On the other hand, when the car is closer to the camera, the object is bigger and there are more big

12
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:23,550
sales to be tracked, so the movements of the big cells will be greater.

13
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:33,360
In short, the closer the object is from the camera, the greater is the variation of the pixels like

14
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,340
the mean shift algorithm.

15
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:41,370
Optical flow also uses HSV color representation.

16
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:51,220
As you can see in this image, leather age, which means you is used to indicate the direction of the

17
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:53,700
pixels where they are moving.

18
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:59,070
These aero can point to the right, left or now.

19
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:08,250
While the -- ladder, the saturation is used to indicate the speeds of the pixels.

20
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:15,750
If the object is moving slowly, the saturation will be low from frame to frame.

21
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:24,180
On the other hand, if the object is moving quickly, the saturation will be high between frames.

22
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:32,190
Finally, leather year, the value indicates the intensity of the colors.

23
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:41,040
The closer the object is to the camera, the greater things that the of the colors, the farther away

24
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:46,200
the object is from the camera, the less intense the colors are.

25
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,080
We can see the definitions here.

26
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:59,190
Age is used to indicate the direction of the big cells where each pixel is moving and saturation leather

27
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:03,960
s is used to indicate this feeds off the pixels.

28
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:09,060
Now we will take a look at the optical flow algorithm.

29
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:18,420
Considering the sparse version, there are two versions of this algorithm sparse and dense, and in

30
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:25,590
this lecture, we will focus only on the sparse version of the optical flow algorithm.

31
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:32,310
Looking at this animation is easier to understand how the algorithm works.

32
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:37,860
The more movements in the image, they bigger the arrows.

33
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:40,650
They are closer to the camera.

34
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:45,660
On the other hand, delays movements in the image.

35
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,340
This smaller drops, they are farther from the camera.

36
00:03:50,670 --> 00:04:00,810
We can see this car here further away with a small arrow, and these are their car close to the camera

37
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:03,060
with a large arrow.

38
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:09,150
We can see the same pattern here on the poles and on their roads.

39
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:15,150
For example, this small here and big here on the roads.

40
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:21,570
In short, the closer to the camera, the more motion will be detected.

41
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:32,910
To calculate how much the pixels are moving, we can use this equation at time, be the current frame

42
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:35,010
and adds time.

43
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,980
The plus one the next frame.

44
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:42,630
This calculation is related to the pixel intensity.

45
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:47,190
The Z channel of the HSV representation.

46
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:56,790
And here we can see that's the big slow is moving to the left and with the intensity decreasing these

47
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:59,880
peaks, so is more intense than.

48
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:08,010
These two big cells here now where we will see some mathematical calculations that are used in this

49
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:14,310
algorithm, it is important to understand because we are going to use them in the implementation.

50
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:24,210
Initially, the algorithm detects corners and edges to get their mind the orientation of the vectors

51
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:29,340
using an algorithm called Harris Gardner detector.

52
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:39,060
It is important to emphasize that in this is that the algorithm will select only some corners of the

53
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:42,480
image and not the complete object.

54
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:47,970
For example, see, that's in this car where I am pointing the mouse.

55
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:55,830
There is only one arrow and lots of bounding box around the entire object.

56
00:05:56,190 --> 00:06:01,260
The algorithm will choose a corner of this image to track.

57
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:11,130
The image will not be processed big, so by Pixel, the algorithm will select only one corner of the

58
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:11,910
object.

59
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:24,180
Here you can see the equation considering X and Y axis of the image, and also that you and the parameters

60
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,380
of the H.

61
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,000
S V matrix.

62
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:38,010
These parameters indicate the movements of the big cells and leather I indicates the peak so intensity.

63
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:48,120
The purpose of the algorithm is to find values for you and Z to know the direction of the arrow.

64
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:57,810
The Arrows Considering this image, then we have the calculation of the matrix determinant, which is

65
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:59,520
an algebra concept.

66
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:10,650
According to these order equation, these words that's here and then we get the results in ladder art.

67
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:18,900
So the first step of the algorithm is to find the initial corners to start tracking.

68
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:29,310
This symbol here indicate the highest value, and this other one indicates this section's highest value.

69
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:34,260
And don't worry about understanding these complex calculations.

70
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:41,730
The idea is just to see the basic equations should be easier to understand the implementations.

71
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:52,080
Researchers Sheet and Stormzy modified the original equation and created a simplified version.

72
00:07:52,320 --> 00:08:01,800
According to these other equation, here, instead of using the Matrix, they use the calculation of

73
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:08,640
the minimum between the highest value and this second highest value.

74
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:17,970
Just a reminder that this calculation will predict if a peak so is that corner or edge of an object?

75
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:25,260
This calculation is performed for all peak cells, and the computational cost is high.

76
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:32,549
So all pensively uses the concept of pyramids called K L.

77
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,890
The methods cannot.

78
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:44,159
Lucas and Tomasi, the name of the researchers, which are three different methods, combines and it

79
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:48,750
will analyze the smaller images of this same frame.

80
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:53,370
It is easier to understand by looking at this image.

81
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:57,780
This bottom part is the whole image.

82
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:10,260
Each layer square is up big, so we can count them one two three four five six seven eight and one two

83
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:20,310
three four five six six rows and eight Carlos multiplying both values six times eight.

84
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:27,090
Their result is for the eight pixels, and we can take a look at this part.

85
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:37,320
Here we have one short three four and one two three four times three equals 12.

86
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:50,700
So from Florida, eight big cells, the image has been reduced to only 12 pixels and then from 12 pixels.

87
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:55,020
The image has been reduced to only four pixels.

88
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,670
And finally, for all four big cells, the image.

89
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:03,590
She has been reduced to only one peak, so.

90
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:08,840
So the image is smaller and the calculation will be faster.

91
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:13,710
On the left, we have the image and style there.

92
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:21,620
And on the right, we have the image at times b plus one because rents.

93
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:32,750
And then next frame of the video after the image size is reduced, the optical flow is calculated from

94
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,040
top to bottom.

95
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:45,140
As you can see the arrows and the goal is to find values for you and envy that will indicate the direction

96
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:48,890
of the arrows or the direction of the object.

97
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:58,940
In short, for the image, dimensions are reduced and then their frames are going backwards using the

98
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:01,610
reversed versions of the images.

99
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,600
The process is starts at I three.

100
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:08,240
I show I one.

101
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:15,110
And finally I zero, which is the number of layers to process the image.

102
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,290
That's all for the basic intuition.

103
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:26,360
In the next lecture we will implement, it's using open Sivy and then it will be easier to understand

104
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,250
some of these concepts.

105
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:29,300
See you there!
