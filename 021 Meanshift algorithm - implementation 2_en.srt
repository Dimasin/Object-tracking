00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:07,550
Hello and welcome to this lecture, where we are going to continue the implementation of the May shift

2
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:08,870
tracking algorithm.

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,740
Just to recap, we can run this code.

4
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:24,040
Then we can get the building blocks, for example, we can select the pen press and there and we can

5
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:28,780
see here that Roy Director Dhiraj of interest.

6
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:35,140
This is the object we once should track, which is the track window.

7
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:41,650
And now we need to perform some brass see on this Roy image.

8
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,790
We'll put these two lines in commands.

9
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:51,610
And as you know, this image is in the RGV for months.

10
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:57,400
Of course, in open CV, the order of the channels are different.

11
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:06,520
So we have beat our image and we need to convert these our r.b.g.

12
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:12,790
Our image Chuan Lauder for months, which is the H s v.

13
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:19,060
It is another caller representation or another caller space.

14
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:28,420
And if you want to know more details about the caller ID spaces, you can follow these first link here,

15
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:33,370
where you can find more information about caller spaces.

16
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:42,640
For example, they are used according to the available light in the environment, the way the objects

17
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:52,120
in this scene that reflect light, the way the light reacts with an animal's eyes and the way received

18
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:53,830
light is processed.

19
00:01:54,280 --> 00:02:03,340
Different color spaces are used, according should these four features here, and we can take a look

20
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:14,100
at the art be quality space, which is the one used in computers and it is considered the default color

21
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:14,860
space.

22
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:22,270
And we can take a look at the age s v color space and it stands off.

23
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:26,740
Have the rads, green and blue channel.

24
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:29,290
We have the rule.

25
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:36,850
This saturation and the value as the mean shift algorithm is based on all laws.

26
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:48,580
We need to convert the image from the our g b format should the H s V formats, because this is how

27
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:59,770
mean shift algorithm was implemented so we can create a new variable age s hit ROI equals spiritual

28
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,240
celebrity.

29
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:06,640
Let's send here the right or the object.

30
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:14,350
One should drag city to caller Kuala BGR chew h.

31
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:23,380
S V, and just to compare the results of each one of the corollaries spaces, we can show the window

32
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:24,330
civic.

33
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:33,750
Sure, i m show let's type here, right h s v h s here, right?

34
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:40,690
See feature, but wait here, let's run this code again.

35
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:46,990
And so it will be easier to see the difference between the actual color spaces.

36
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:57,930
We can select the right again, let's press and there and now we can see the difference between the

37
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:04,420
original one and the color changed from our GP to HSV.

38
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:07,640
We can delete this comment here.

39
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,290
Let's run again.

40
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:14,940
Let's select the part of the ban again.

41
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,070
Press enter.

42
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:19,850
Now we can see both spaces.

43
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:27,350
The original one, the IGB and the same image converted to HSV.

44
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:37,070
We can put this line in the comments and this is the first pre-processing step we need to convert the

45
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:41,060
object from our GP to HSV.

46
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:52,040
Then we will need to perform these calculations here to approximate the number of big cells should these

47
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,180
areas are.

48
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:55,850
Should these bars, for example?

49
00:04:56,090 --> 00:05:02,990
This is the biggest one because there are more big cells in this window here.

50
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:11,120
This is this sac big guests, because that our last big cells than this one here.

51
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:21,740
And then we need to approximate these bars should then next frame of the video in order to keep tracking

52
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:22,640
the object.

53
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:28,850
We need to compare the previous frame with the next frame.

54
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:38,070
And the next step now is to generate these bars and the bars are called histogram.

55
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:42,440
And you can follow this link to know more details.

56
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:46,010
We can take a look at the theory here.

57
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:56,090
The Instagram is a graph are blots, which gives you an overall idea about the things that the distribution

58
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,200
of an image.

59
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:04,220
For example, we are going to count the number of big cells, according to the.

60
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:09,800
For example, see, that's in this part of the image.

61
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:20,810
We can see the brown color and the number of brown big cells are higher than the number of these color

62
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:22,680
here near this see.

63
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:30,570
So the bar regarding the brown color is bigger than the bar.

64
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:39,890
Regarding these other color, because the number of brown pigs cells are greater than the number of

65
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:41,570
these white pig.

66
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:49,730
So here and we can also take a look at this point here, which is a different color.

67
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:57,230
But as this small thing is far from the camera, the color is quite a difference.

68
00:06:57,590 --> 00:07:05,960
And then the number of big cells belonging to this squalor is is smaller than the number of big cells

69
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:09,020
belonging to this or other brown color.

70
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:18,560
So basically, the histogram will give us the number of peak cells belonging to each one of the different

71
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,300
colors of the image.

72
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:23,100
Going back to these is light.

73
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:29,510
Here we can consider these points here as the brown color.

74
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:34,960
These are other points here as these are either called or here.

75
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:41,240
And finally, decide they're part two here as these white collar.

76
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:50,810
So basically, in order to perform the calculations, the makeshift algorithm will use the histogram

77
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:56,480
with the number of pixels off each one of the colors of the image.

78
00:07:56,750 --> 00:08:06,200
So then we can compare these histograms with the histograms of the next frame of the video.

79
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:16,550
If the algorithm can find similarities between both histograms, it means that it can keep tracking

80
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:17,540
the object.

81
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:26,120
This is how Ming Shift finds similarity between the courants and the max frame of the video.

82
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:29,060
It will compare the histograms.

83
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:38,390
Here, you can find the open civil codes to get the histogram of the image, and now we are going to

84
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:39,470
implement it.

85
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:50,330
Let's go back to the bicarb project and we'll create another variable right highest civic hue dots,

86
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:57,020
calc history and the first parameter is h se v at right.

87
00:08:57,290 --> 00:09:04,520
We are going to get the histogram regarding the right converted to H.

88
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,800
S V Colors space.

89
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:10,460
The next parameter is the number of.

90
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:14,530
Channels, we are going to use only one channel.

91
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:21,700
If you want to know more details about the parameters, you can check this link here.

92
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:29,410
For example, if the input image is in grayscale, the value is zero.

93
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:32,860
So we are going to get the histogram.

94
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:43,060
Considering our grayscale image, then the X parameter is the mask image and we need you sat as no one

95
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:47,230
to find the histogram of full image.

96
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:53,020
And as we need to get the histogram of the ROI, we need you.

97
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:54,210
None.

98
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,400
Here we would use this barometer.

99
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:07,450
If we want to find the histogram of a particular region of the image, then the X parameter is the least

100
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:08,260
size.

101
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:18,460
These represent the beam counts, which is the number of bars that will be generated or the number of

102
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,450
ether votes.

103
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:28,720
For example, in this image, there are about 20 bars, so that barometer would be equal to 20.

104
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:38,560
We can type one hundred and eighty, which is the number of bars that will be generated or the number

105
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:44,740
of colour intervals, and in the documentation ofmy shift algorithm.

106
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:51,970
It is recommended to use this value in the last parameter, our order ranges.

107
00:10:52,090 --> 00:11:01,780
For example, the default value from zero to 200 and 55, which is the IGB interval.

108
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:11,620
And as we are working with age s v, the range will be from zero to one hundred and eighty.

109
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:20,710
So now we have the histogram of the array and we can visualize a graph like this.

110
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:28,930
One here should show the number of pixels according to each one of the callers should do that.

111
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:31,780
We are going to use another library.

112
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:34,230
I will click here and there.

113
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:44,170
Now let's install maths blots live, which is the default library to generate graphs in Python.

114
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:49,150
We can see that the installation was done successfully.

115
00:11:49,630 --> 00:12:01,630
Now we can import this library import Matt blot lib by brought s BLT, and we can use Matt Blot Lib

116
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:03,730
to generate the histogram.

117
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:10,720
Lets type he's ROI and I will define the same parameters.

118
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:18,640
Then we can show the graph switcher weight gain zero.

119
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,340
Let's run this code.

120
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:33,250
And when it was returned here, because these right variable is an image, so it is in the matrix formats

121
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:41,470
and we need to convert enough vector formats only one dimension to generate the histogram.

122
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:44,860
Let's try to run this code again.

123
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:51,970
The first step is just select the right press and through.

124
00:12:53,260 --> 00:13:01,060
And we can see the result here, which is quite similar to that one in open civil documentation.

125
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:07,540
We can see here the total amount of big cells regarding each one of the callers.

126
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:21,010
Most of the values are in the range from 75 to 175, which are related to the yellow collar, according

127
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:21,850
to the ban.

128
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:30,410
In short, these are the most frequent callers and take a look here that we are generating.

129
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:38,560
The histogram using the original image so it is easier to see the results.

130
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:42,700
Now we can put these codes in comments.

131
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:46,990
We are not going to visualize that this graph anymore.

132
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:53,050
It was used just to see the results and the last step of this lecturer.

133
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:56,200
We will recreate high.

134
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:10,900
His equal spiritual dots normalize as we know the values are in the range from zero to 255.

135
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:16,450
And we need to convert them into range from zero to one.

136
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:20,410
So it will be faster to process is the algorithm.

137
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,560
We are going to normalize the image.

138
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:35,770
We are going to stand here the high wrist again, the right history, the original interval zero, two

139
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:42,880
hundred and fifty five spiritual ma'am mean max.

140
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:52,330
This option will convert the values of the pixels in the range from zero to one, and then the next

141
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:57,730
and last lecture we are going to finally visualize the results.

142
00:14:58,210 --> 00:14:58,930
See you there!
