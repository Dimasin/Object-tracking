00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:08,250
Hello and welcome to this lecture, where you are going to learn the differences between object tracking

2
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:10,380
and object detection.

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:18,600
Sometimes both terms are used as if they were the same, but there is a very important difference,

4
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:24,330
mainly regarding how the implementation of the algorithms was made.

5
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:32,340
In general, tracking algorithms are much faster than detection algorithms because it should track and

6
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:33,090
object.

7
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:41,380
The algorithm already knows what it looks like in order to track it in the next frames of the video.

8
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:50,760
For example, let's suppose that the goal is to track the runner to the and off the track in this frame

9
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,390
here.

10
00:00:51,660 --> 00:01:00,870
We already have basic information about the object, and when you are in this position here where I

11
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:08,310
am pointing the mouse, we can use this information about the features of the object.

12
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:17,940
And also the algorithms can detect a kind of patterns that indicates the direction and speed of the

13
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:18,630
object.

14
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:24,540
The runner is following the track from left to right.

15
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:32,490
So the algorithm already knows that in the next frame of the video, the person will be here.

16
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:40,830
In short, this information is used to predict the location of the object in the next frame.

17
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:50,010
For this reason, tracking algorithms are faster because they use existing data, whereas a detection

18
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:57,960
algorithm would have to be executed from scratch frame by frame without reusing data.

19
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:01,260
It would take a longer time to execute.

20
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:08,850
On the other hand, tracking algorithms can have a little difficulty in tracking objects that change

21
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:10,500
position drastically.

22
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:20,040
For example, if in the next frame, the person appears below here instead of following the straight

23
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:20,550
line.

24
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:26,490
In this situation, it will be difficult for the algorithm to follow the object.

25
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:37,830
If there is a video composed of 100 frames, a detection algorithm will run 100 times once for each

26
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:38,400
frame.

27
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:46,740
On the other hand, are tracking algorithm will detect the object only in the first frame, and then

28
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:51,540
it will use that information until the end of the video.

29
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,990
When you start working with some algorithms, it is common to have some problems.

30
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:08,130
For example, in this image here, see, that's the bounding box moves away from the object, and it

31
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:11,370
can happen when the speed is very high.

32
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:17,820
And the algorithm loses contact with the object in this other image here.

33
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:25,860
See, that's the lag of the runner does not appear very well due to the speeds.

34
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:34,650
Therefore, the algorithm can also have difficulties in tracking the objects, and the bounding box

35
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:36,630
was placed higher.

36
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:41,710
To solve this type of problem, you can try different algorithms.

37
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:45,510
Some of them are suitable for faster videos.

38
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:54,180
Later in this class, you will learn a lot of algorithms and we will be able to perform some tests related

39
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,140
to this issue.

40
00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:00,780
Another solution to this problem is to use a detection algorithm again.

41
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:01,350
Sure.

42
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:03,480
Is that the tracking algorithm?

43
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:11,830
For example, when this bounding box here loses the object, we run the detection algorithm again,

44
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:12,920
chalkboards.

45
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:19,560
The building blocks in this position here again so that the tracking starts again.

46
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:24,120
Later, we will implement tracking less detection.

47
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:32,070
Finally, a tracking algorithm can adapt to small variations in the images in the videos.

48
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:41,880
For example, in these cases where the person boards here are her hands in front of the face, a face

49
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:47,930
recognition algorithm would probably not recognize the faces.

50
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:48,770
Why?

51
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:53,220
What tracking algorithm would still be executing correctly?

52
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:59,250
It happens because a tracking algorithm considers the location and.

53
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:02,980
You rinse off the object in the previous frame.

54
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:13,530
In the previous frame, the algorithm identifies that the dispersant here did not have his hands in

55
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:15,210
front of his face.

56
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:23,370
And when the person puts the hands in front of the face, the algorithm will continue tracking.

57
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:33,210
In other words, the algorithm already has the information for the right part of the face here, which

58
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:36,330
was obtained from the previous frame.

59
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:44,160
This animation shows the differences between tracking and detection, as you can read here.

60
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:48,000
Tracking preserves the object's identity.

61
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:55,620
Once the algorithm starts tracking, the object is treated as a single entity.

62
00:05:55,830 --> 00:06:01,200
For example, look at this orange point where I'm pointing the mouse.

63
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,450
It has this same color from the beginning to the ends of the trace.

64
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:12,780
It's the same object and it indicates where the object is going.

65
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:18,930
On the other hand, the detection only analyze each frame of the video.

66
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:23,790
It's not possible to follow the path of the object.

67
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,920
That's all for this lecture.

68
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:33,420
And then the next one, you will start learning the basic intuition about some tracking algorithms.

69
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:34,470
See you there!
