Hello and welcome to This Week lecture where you were going to learn the basic intuition about the calm

2
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:18,150
shift algorithm, which is an improvement on the main shift you learned before we added this three ladders

3
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:26,700
C, A and M, which means continuously adaptive means shift less lecturer.

4
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:36,480
We perform some tasks using means shift and evolving box was always the same size, whether the object

5
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,120
is near or far from the camera.

6
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:47,700
If you remember the practical implementation when we move to the band, the size of the body box was

7
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:48,810
always the same.

8
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:57,240
The main feature of this new algorithm is that the building blocks will update according to the size

9
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:01,470
of the object if it is close to the camera.

10
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:10,170
The building blocks will be larger, while the building blocks will be smaller if the object is far

11
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,250
from the camera.

12
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:20,550
It is a dynamic process which gives the more quality for tracking with respect to mathematics.

13
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:26,790
It also uses average calculations like the May Shift algorithm.

14
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:31,110
This image shows how the algorithm works.

15
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:40,770
We can see this red rectangle that is the equation of the mean shift going through the image when the

16
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:43,440
region of interest is found.

17
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:54,420
The yellow rectangle here, this circle will be created, so it will increase the size of the building

18
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:54,930
blocks.

19
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:04,260
See that in the first runs, the building blocks is small, and after increasing the size, the algorithm

20
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:10,440
manages to select the entire face of the person, as we can see here.

21
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:17,580
For this reason, it is possible to track objects far or close to the camera.

22
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:23,740
If you want to know more details, you can follow each step of the algorithm.

23
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:34,800
Reading these messages that appear in each change of state, for example, may shift 1st, 2nd and 3rd

24
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:38,880
right for the ellipsis generation and so on.

25
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:47,280
This is the basic information about kinship, and in the next lecture, we will implement it and perform

26
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,900
some tests to compare the results with the mean shift algorithm.

27
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:53,220
See you there!
