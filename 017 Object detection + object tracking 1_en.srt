00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:07,530
Hello and welcome to this lecture, where we are going to start the implementation of the combination

2
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:12,180
of the tracking algorithm with the detection algorithm.

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:22,350
Just a reminder that last lecture you understood how to use the higher Cascada detector to detect the

4
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:24,330
full body of people.

5
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:29,100
Now let's create a new file by file.

6
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:34,920
The name of this file will be detection tracking.

7
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:52,150
Let's import the library's important spiritual import sis am from random import rant ins.

8
00:00:52,860 --> 00:01:04,110
Now let's create the tracker equals spiritual legacy, and we use Tracker C as our theme.

9
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:07,230
You can use the one you want.

10
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:14,400
We are going to use SRT because, as we saw before, it too has the best results.

11
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:26,900
Now we can go to this single tracking and now we we'll just copy this code here to load the video based

12
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:27,300
IDs.

13
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:32,790
And let's paste the new video that we are going to use.

14
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:36,060
Click here on based walking.

15
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:41,970
The name of the file and you can get this video in the class materials.

16
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:47,280
Here is the video that we are going to use in this case study.

17
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:55,440
We can see a lot of people walking on this street, and the goal is just to select a specific person

18
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,670
and track the person until the end of the video.

19
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:08,780
And if we use a tracking algorithm after some frames the tracking algorithm, we will lose the object

20
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:16,950
and then we are going to use the detection algorithm to try to get to the object again.

21
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,300
Then we can restart the tracking algorithm.

22
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,550
Let's just change the name here walking.

23
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:31,290
But, Azi, let's run these quotes.

24
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:33,930
No, it was returns.

25
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,980
So the video was loaded correctly.

26
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:43,020
And also, we could get the first frame of the video.

27
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:49,510
Now we will create the cascaded detector, which will be equal.

28
00:02:50,220 --> 00:03:03,910
See Richard Gasquet classifier and let's sand to hear the full path of the file full body Dodd's x m

29
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:04,350
l.

30
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:13,260
As you saw in the video, we have the full body of people so we can use this file here.

31
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:22,920
If you are working with eye tracking or only tracking the from tho face of people, you can use these

32
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:33,360
or other cascade files and we will create a new function that detects it wont receive any parameter.

33
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:37,770
Let's see implements a while while true.

34
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:39,200
OK.

35
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:44,250
And Frame Hadeel Dot reads.

36
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,500
See here that we are reading the next frame of the video.

37
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:55,170
Now we will get the frame, which is the first image.

38
00:03:55,410 --> 00:04:04,260
And let's go over to Grayscale as you learn in the last lecture to work with the Cascade classifier,

39
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:12,510
it is recommended to convert the IAG B image short grayscale image.

40
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:26,520
We will implement a similar code we implement as before severity call the frame signature color b g

41
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,290
r sugary.

42
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:43,150
After we convert, we can get the detections equals cascades and let's go detect multi scale and let's

43
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:44,220
send it here.

44
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:46,590
The grayscale image.

45
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:52,860
Now we need to go through the building blocks exactly the same with the ID here.

46
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:58,710
See that we first get the detections and then we need to go through.

47
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:06,370
Each one of the detections are the building blocks for x y.

48
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:11,730
We live in the hive in detections.

49
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:16,650
I will draw direct dango frame.

50
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:22,440
Take a look here that we are covered in the image true grayscale.

51
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:32,190
We are detecting the full body in degrees Q image, but we are going to show the results in the our

52
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,390
G.B. image.

53
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,070
Let's split here.

54
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:37,000
The first point?

55
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:47,850
The last point X blurs with f y B+ hiph the color of the boarding box.

56
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,240
Zero zero two five five.

57
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,710
And this size?

58
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,860
Sure, let's show the results.

59
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,120
C Ritual.

60
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:03,660
I am show detection, and let's put the frame here.

61
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:15,990
After that, we can visualize the results spiritual weight here and after we press a key, let's destroy

62
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:20,580
all windows to release the memory.

63
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:25,080
Now we can perform the first tests using this function.

64
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:30,840
Let's call it detects and we'll run these codes.

65
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:34,200
We can take a look at some images.

66
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:39,810
This is the second frame of the video since we have here.

67
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:48,300
This code ETRADE's the first frame and the higher Cascades wasn't able to detect the full body in this

68
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:48,760
frame.

69
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:55,590
We can press any key, then we move on to the next frame of the video.

70
00:06:55,950 --> 00:07:05,610
The algorithm is detecting this rock here as if it were a person, but now we can see that the algorithm

71
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:09,420
could detect the full body of this person.

72
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:13,410
Here we can move on to the next frames.

73
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:21,440
We can see that's the algorithm can detect other people and you can press and.

74
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,080
Are you can press any other key on your keyboard?

75
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:31,690
And you can see that's the algorithm is detecting the full body of people.

76
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:39,040
Of course, there are some errors here, but it once be a problem for our case study.

77
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:49,570
I will click this button here to stop this crucial, and they go of this function is to detect the first

78
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:58,900
person who appears in the first frame of the video, as we can see here in this single tracking when

79
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,880
we run this code.

80
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:11,830
We need to select the building blocks in order to start tracking them when we press anther.

81
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:20,380
The algorithm starts is incubating birds in this other case is third that we are implementing.

82
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:27,250
The goal is to select the first burst so that the algorithm could detect.

83
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:32,530
So we are not going to use this function here.

84
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:42,159
This will act right because when you use this function, a window will appear and you need to select

85
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,140
the object by yourself.

86
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:53,620
But in these other cases, they will automatically select the first body that appears in the video.

87
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:59,560
And in order to do that, we can implement an if statement.

88
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:03,640
If X greater than zero.

89
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:16,810
If a detection was found, then we can just sprints higher cascades detection and then we can return

90
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:20,320
the building blocks x y.

91
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:22,480
We live and hiph.

92
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:32,440
The difference is that a single tracking, we select the object and we have here the building blocks

93
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:35,080
according to our selection.

94
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:44,710
Now we will return the building blocks according to the first frame of the video, or in other words,

95
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:49,030
according should the first object that was detected.

96
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:59,560
Now we can create the building blocks here, and then we can just sprints the beat box.

97
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,530
Let's run this code.

98
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:06,520
We can click here, stop and rerun.

99
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:15,370
See that we have the detection, hard cascaded detection, and we have only the first building blocks.

100
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:18,910
This is the X and Y positions.

101
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:29,410
And here we can see this size of the object that was detected, and in the next lecture, we will initialize

102
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:31,180
our tracker.

103
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:41,140
According to these body blocks here and then we combine both algorithms, the detection algorithms and

104
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,550
the tracking algorithm.

105
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:43,690
See you there.
