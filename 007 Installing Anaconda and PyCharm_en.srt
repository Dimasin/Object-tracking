00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:07,710
Hello and welcome to this lecture, where I'm going to show you how you can install Anaconda and by

2
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:15,120
charm on your old machine seals, all examples will be implemented using both tools.

3
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:20,970
You can access the Anaconda website, as you can see here.

4
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,000
Let's click this option here.

5
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,760
Then you can download it according to your operating system.

6
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:37,320
We can see that it's possible to download for Windows, Mac and also Linux.

7
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:45,480
When you click this button and the installation file will be downloaded and you must run it and follow

8
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,500
these directions.

9
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:54,450
I'm not going to show you this process step by step because it's basically following these structures

10
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:55,230
on this screen.

11
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:57,880
In case you don't know, Anaconda.

12
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:06,240
It is one of the most used tools for programming in Python, especially for working with artificial

13
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,550
intelligence and data science.

14
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:18,240
The advantage is that several air specific libraries are already installed, and it is also possible

15
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,980
to create environments with different versions of Python.

16
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:32,280
For example, one environment using Python two and another environment using Python three and one environments

17
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,590
does not influence the other.

18
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:44,490
Then the next step is to install by Sharp, as you can see here, which is an IEEE for working with

19
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:47,460
Python less click downloads.

20
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:54,270
Let's choose the community version, which is the free version when you click.

21
00:01:54,270 --> 00:02:01,920
This link and installation file will be downloaded, and you must run this and follow the instructions.

22
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:09,840
Again, I'm not going to show you the process is a step by step because it's basically following the

23
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,810
instructions on this screen after installing it.

24
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:19,200
You can open by sharp great this button here.

25
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:27,900
New project Then you can select the location where you are going to save the project.

26
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,810
For example, in my case tracking, let's keep this option.

27
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:40,550
New environments using one that select Python version, for example.

28
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:46,680
Three point nine and then let's create this last button here.

29
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:50,940
It will take some minutes to create the new projects.

30
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:53,910
You may see this screen here.

31
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:59,040
In this left part, we can access all the files.

32
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:04,320
And in the center part is where we are going to Typekit the codes.

33
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:12,390
Now we need to install open library in order to have access to the tracking algorithms.

34
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,280
We can create this button here.

35
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:26,220
There are, and let's type PIP install open CV by press and there.

36
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:34,400
We can see here that it is downloading the library and also installing some dependencies.

37
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,400
Now we need to install another library.

38
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,080
Let's type again.

39
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:46,310
You install open civil country Python.

40
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:52,910
We need this country package to have access to the tracking algorithms.

41
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:55,280
Let's press and through again.

42
00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:01,610
We can see that it is download and install needed packages.

43
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:08,210
Now we can perform a test just to make sure the installation was done successfully.

44
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:14,510
Let's click in the name of the project's Neil by phone fail.

45
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:20,420
Let's call this first fail fast open CV.

46
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:32,340
Let's start in part CV two, which means the library we have just installed lets type see visual thoughts.

47
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:44,450
Version we can Gleek run fast, open CV nowhere or was returns, so it means that the installation was

48
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,950
done successfully.

49
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:51,410
We can just prints the version of open CV we are using.

50
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:53,870
Let's run this code again.

51
00:04:54,290 --> 00:05:03,590
See that we have version four point five point four, and in the next lecture, we are going to start

52
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:05,420
implementing the algorithms.

53
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:06,440
See you there!
