00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:06,960
Hello and welcome to this lecture, where we are going to start the implementation of the mean shift

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:07,710
algorithm.

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,620
We are back to the bike sharing project.

4
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:14,730
Let's create a new bike file.

5
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:19,650
The name of this file will be mission shift.

6
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:28,050
Let's see boards the libraries in Part C ritual and the we will install another library.

7
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:34,710
We can click here and there are, you know, and let's type be installed.

8
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,490
I am or those breaths.

9
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:40,680
And there we can see here.

10
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,250
That's the installation was successfully done.

11
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,990
And this is a library to work with videos in Python.

12
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:51,840
We will use it in some sections.

13
00:00:52,200 --> 00:01:05,459
Now we can import a class from this new library from I am would use that video import video stream in

14
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:06,780
this case study.

15
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:14,100
We are not going to load a video from this folder here, as we did before.

16
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:17,790
We will load the videos from the web cam.

17
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:27,950
Now we can create the capture variable video history in this new class that we have just part.

18
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:37,350
It's the first parameter is this service which will be equal to zero, which means the web can in case

19
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:41,730
you have more cameras installed on your computer.

20
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:50,730
The webcam will be camera zero and the other cameras will be camera one, camera two, camera three

21
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:51,690
and so one.

22
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:57,780
And now we are going to start capturing the images from the webcam.

23
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:02,370
How will we import and larger library here in time?

24
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,430
And let's type here?

25
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:18,030
I thought this is a Leap One, which means that we are going to wait one seconds before we start capturing

26
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:20,190
the images from the webcam.

27
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:29,070
And we need these quotes because when we are capturing videos from the webcam, it needs some seconds

28
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:32,250
in order to adapt to the environment.

29
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:39,240
For example, maybe you have already seen that when you turn on the webcam.

30
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:45,420
It takes one or two seconds to adapt to the light conditions.

31
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:54,960
For example, even if you were in a light environment when you open the webcam in the first Milicic

32
00:02:54,960 --> 00:03:02,760
once the image will be quite dark because the webcam is adapting to the environment.

33
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:11,280
So we are going to use these codes to wait one sec once to give time.

34
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:20,010
Should the webcam adapts, should the lightning conditions and we are going to select the object was

35
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:23,070
should track after this process.

36
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:32,310
In short, we are giving one seconds to the webcam, adapts to the light and in conditions of the environment.

37
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:40,960
Now we can recreate the cap variable civic through video capture.

38
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:48,600
Again, we will put zero, which means that we are getting the images from the webcam.

39
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:58,350
If you remember the order lecturers here, we typed the path of the video, so the code is the same.

40
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,960
Three video files are to get the video from the webcam.

41
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:10,760
I will create new variables or OK and frame equals.

42
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,870
Yep, that reads.

43
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:20,820
To get the first frame of the video are the first frame when the webcam is initialized.

44
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:24,150
Just a reminder that this variable.

45
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:29,940
OK will tell was if the connection was made successfully.

46
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:36,740
We can just prints OK just to see if we can get the images from the webcam.

47
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:38,880
Let's run this code.

48
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,880
We can see this message here.

49
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:53,160
It means we could get the video from the webcam now will create the beatbox variable civic through dots.

50
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,200
Select Right.

51
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,400
We are going to select the object from the webcam.

52
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,440
Will put the heater the first frame of the video after selecting the building blocks.

53
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:16,210
Let's create x y width and the hive variables equals B box.

54
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:25,670
We can create another variable and we call it as tracking window, which is the object which one should

55
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:31,150
track, and it will be equal to each one of these variables here.

56
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:37,820
Let's sprints the track window just to see the results.

57
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,670
Now we can run this code.

58
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:44,300
We can see the first frame of the video.

59
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:50,660
I am holding up ban and the goal will be to track this span.

60
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:57,500
We can select a small bounding box here just with this part.

61
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:06,580
And after pressing space or enter, we can see that we have the same messages as before we get.

62
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:13,430
As a result, the building blocks of the initial object that we want should track.

63
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:24,200
We can see here Position X, Position Y and this size of the building blocks just that small part of

64
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:24,830
the BAM.

65
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:34,340
Now we need to create a new image which will be equal to all these part of the image.

66
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:43,160
Only the objects are the part of the band I selected before the object one should track.

67
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:54,740
So we can create a new variable called ROI, which means region of interest and we can access our frame.

68
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:58,880
This is the initial frame that was rad.

69
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:07,190
The here and now we can type the following codes Y and feel y plus h.

70
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,460
This is the initial position of the image.

71
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:15,080
X x plus w.

72
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:24,720
We are using these two variables here to get the initial points of the building blocks, and these are

73
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:31,100
their points here which are related to this size of the object we select.

74
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:35,530
This sugar adds only that's part of the image.

75
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:45,620
We can visualize the results, see which I am sure the title of the window, right?

76
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:52,370
And let's put here the new variable and see which to weight.

77
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:53,820
Kim No.

78
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:54,650
Zero.

79
00:07:54,950 --> 00:08:00,200
The window will be opened until we press a key on the keyboard.

80
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:03,320
Now, let's run this code again.

81
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:09,950
I will select the building blocks a small one here.

82
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:11,750
Press enter.

83
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:24,170
And we can see this order window here with just off this part of the image that I have just selected.

84
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:34,280
We first need to get to this initial part in order to sans should the algorithm, so it will track only

85
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,230
this part of the ban.

86
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:44,340
And this is the first part of the implementation where we give time to the webcam to adapt.

87
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:53,000
Should the lightning conditions with select, the object we want should drag using select drive from

88
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:00,080
open sivy and then we get only the part of the image that we should track.

89
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:04,220
And in the next lecture, we will continue the implementation.

90
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:05,300
See you there!
