00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:07,680
Hello and welcome to this lecture, where we are going to continue the implementation of multiple strategy.

2
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:15,240
Just a reminder that last lecture, we just did some improvements on this single tracking quote.

3
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:26,100
Now we copied this part here where we are loading the video copy and paste it here.

4
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,770
We can put this brilliance in comments.

5
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:35,250
We are just loading the video and then we will define new variables.

6
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:47,400
The first one bit boxes and empty list and colors again, and the lists in this single tracking example,

7
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:56,130
we have only one building blocks and now we need to select more than one building blocks in the first

8
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:57,720
frame of the video.

9
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:06,210
So we are going to start all the bounding boxes and the corresponding colors in these new variables,

10
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,410
how we will define a look way through.

11
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:24,210
Let's create the big box variable true thoughts select ROI in order to select the region of interest.

12
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,340
Let's Typekit here.

13
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,770
Load the tracker.

14
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:36,390
It is the name of the window, and we also need to specify the first frame of the video.

15
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,690
Let's create these variables here.

16
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,220
OK?

17
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,420
And frame Hadeel thought rate.

18
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:48,600
We are accessing this variable here.

19
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:54,180
We are copying through the frame variable, the first frame of the video.

20
00:01:54,630 --> 00:02:05,280
After selecting the building blocks, we will access the big box is variable dots are bands b box.

21
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:10,110
We are adding the boarding box to this list here.

22
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:14,580
We also need to access the colors variable.

23
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:21,000
And let's define the random numbers in order to have different colors.

24
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,440
Reds ends.

25
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:34,260
Zero two five five Common Grounds ends zero two five five All My Rands ends zero two five five.

26
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:39,930
We are generating a different color for each one of the boarding boxes.

27
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:49,620
Now we need to define the key should be pressed on the keyboards to interrupt the execution of this

28
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:57,810
while loop after we select all objects that one should track and we will create a new variable.

29
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:03,300
Key equals C ritual weight Typekit zero.

30
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:13,290
This parameter zero is expecting a key from the keyboards and we also need this exact decimal codes.

31
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:20,160
And now we can just check if key equals one one three.

32
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:26,700
This is the codes for ladder key, which means quid's.

33
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:33,540
So when we press wits, we will interrupt the execution of the while loop.

34
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:39,510
Then we can just break the code to be easier fast to this code.

35
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:41,850
Let's sprints two messages.

36
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:50,530
Press key should quit and start tracking.

37
00:03:50,880 --> 00:04:00,480
And another print press and your other key should select the next object.

38
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,570
Now, let's run this code.

39
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:08,580
We have that same in messages so we can open this window.

40
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:19,829
Let's suppose we want to track this runner with select the him, and then we press Space R and through

41
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:22,500
to confirm the selection.

42
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,720
Let's press enter.

43
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:35,460
Now we can see the new messages press key to quit and start tracking and press any other key to select

44
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:36,810
the next object.

45
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:43,140
If we press key, see that there is a queue show is interrupt.

46
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:51,120
So it means we and third this if statement here and the while loop is stopped.

47
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,100
Let's run again.

48
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,800
We'll select the runner.

49
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,720
Press enter.

50
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,970
And now we can press and.

51
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:07,530
The other, a key to select the next object, you can't press any other ladder, for example, A, B,

52
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:09,810
C, D, B and so on.

53
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:18,720
How we press ladder B, we can see the message again, select the ROI and then press space or enter.

54
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:24,000
I will select these other runner press and third.

55
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:26,640
Now we can see this message again.

56
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:33,930
Let's suppose we want to select another object so we can press any other key.

57
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:39,990
For example, Ladder A, we select the order enter.

58
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:49,890
And when we finish selecting all the objects one should track, we can press key and then the wire loop

59
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:53,520
is interrupted to see the bounding boxes.

60
00:05:53,940 --> 00:06:03,780
We can print bit boxes and we can also prints the colors off each one of them.

61
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:06,690
Let's run again.

62
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:17,160
I will select the first runner press and there I will type Leader B to select the next runner.

63
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,320
Press and their ladder B or any other key.

64
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:24,930
Just select other objects.

65
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:28,080
I will select this one here.

66
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,610
Press Enter.

67
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:35,820
Then I will press Ladder Q and then we can see the results.

68
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:43,950
Three bounding boxes with three corresponding our g b colors.

69
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:51,150
And this is the codes needed to select each one of the objects one should track.

70
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:57,090
We need three bounding boxes and three different colours.

71
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:01,230
And in the next lecture, we will finish the implementation.

72
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,240
See you there!
