00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:07,650
Hello and welcome to this lecture, where you are going to learn the basic intuition about true tracking

2
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:08,520
algorithms.

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:14,070
And the first one is boasting, as you can read, here it is.

4
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:18,360
A low algorithm does not work very well.

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:28,590
It's not so efficient, and it is based on the higher cascade classifier with the other boost algorithm.

6
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:35,340
This is the algorithm used for detecting faces and objects with open CV.

7
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,860
It is one of the simplest techniques for detecting objects.

8
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:49,020
Training is online, meaning that learning happens when you want to track and object.

9
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,150
It uses the concept of positive and negative images.

10
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:03,240
The positive image is the object you want to track, while the negative image is the background.

11
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:14,610
For example, in this image here, you must create the initial bounding box by selecting the objects

12
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:18,150
to be tracked, which is the positive image.

13
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:22,810
And the rest of the image is the negative part.

14
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:25,410
That does not have the object.

15
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,690
For example, the house, the wall, the people here.

16
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:33,900
And so one each part one.

17
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:42,930
If it is the object and zero, if it is the background, we can redo the definition here.

18
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:52,500
The initial bounding box this blue building blocks here is the positive example, and the rest of the

19
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,500
image is treated as the background.

20
00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:06,090
The negative examples we can consider that this image is the first frame of the video, and this one

21
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:12,300
is this second frame in which the person has his back turns.

22
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:23,040
See that we still have the blue bounding box that indicates the object and choose author orange boxes

23
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,240
were created, which are the negative examples.

24
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:32,400
Of course, more boxes will be generated and not just chew.

25
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:41,040
The next step to continue tracking the object is to generate the probabilities for each one, and the

26
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:47,730
one with the highest value will be considered as the positive building blocks.

27
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:54,390
Here, the blue box adds the highest probability compared to the others.

28
00:02:54,810 --> 00:03:06,060
It's similar to this slide here, where the goal is to select nearby bounding boxes and return probabilities

29
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,770
to each one of them.

30
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:12,330
And that's all for the basic intuition about boosting.

31
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:22,950
The next one is m i l multiple instance learning, and generally it has better results than boasting.

32
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:32,460
The training is quite similar and see that in this image, we have the positive examples in Grimm.

33
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:41,130
Let's suppose you selected only this region of the image where I am pointing the mouse.

34
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:51,090
Then the algorithm itself creates either balding boxes to increase the image area, as you can see here,

35
00:03:51,360 --> 00:04:02,220
that are two additional bounding boxes instead of using just one positive example that are several orders

36
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:06,450
that are created automatically on the order hands.

37
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:17,610
Negative examples These red rectangles here are also created far from the positive examples, each short.

38
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:27,210
Rather than just considering the object's current location as a single positive example, the algorithm

39
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:37,230
looks for positions around the current location to generate several, but they show positive examples

40
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:41,310
scenes that are three positive examples.

41
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:49,590
The probability of selecting them is greater than if we had only one positive example.

42
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:59,730
Again, as for boosting probabilities will also be generated and only one bounding box will.

43
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:08,790
Is selected to continue tracking the object, this other image show this process in more detail where

44
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:18,990
you can see the positive X samples that are around the face of the person shift to the right and shift

45
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:22,680
to the left when the prediction is made.

46
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:30,270
Only one of these regions will be selected is the one with the highest probability.

47
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:40,860
We can also look at the negative X samples that are far from the positive X samples with this parts

48
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:43,290
of the shoulder of the person.

49
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:53,130
The advantage of this algorithm, if compared to boasting, is that even if the object's current location

50
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,890
is not found, exactly.

51
00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:03,240
If we use this order, balding box is here, we can still tracking the object.

52
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:09,150
And that's all for this basic intuition about this two algorithms.

53
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:13,840
And in the next lecture, you are going to understand the intuition show.

54
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:17,760
So more tracking algorithms see you there.
