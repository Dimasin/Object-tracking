00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:07,290
Hello and welcome to this lecture, where you were going to learn the basic intuition about two other

2
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:08,670
tracking algorithms.

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:16,780
The first one is key C.F. kernel correlation futures, which is a fast algorithm.

4
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:22,770
However, it doesn't perform very well, especially in fast videos.

5
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:29,570
And one of the most common problems is when the building blocks loses the object.

6
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:40,470
As you can see here and here, GAISF is an extension of an AI algorithm that presents some improvements

7
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:49,260
and considers that in the AM AI algorithm, there are many overlapping regions, as you can see here.

8
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:53,340
One box can be created above all others.

9
00:00:53,580 --> 00:01:02,760
So Cases aims to solve this problem, so this image shows an example of how it works.

10
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:10,980
We have here the first frame, which is the initialization are the definition of the objects should

11
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:14,280
be detected when working with videos.

12
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:20,190
We use the first frame to select the object we want to track.

13
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:25,620
Let's assume that we selected this red frame here.

14
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:29,890
For example, the goal is to track this face.

15
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:36,540
So the algorithm applies a concept called particle filter.

16
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:47,580
As you can read here and show, more large bounding boxes are created to cover a larger part of the

17
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:48,210
image.

18
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:56,790
Here the blue one and here degree in the one next front frame choo choo frame three.

19
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:06,150
The larger rectangle is used the green one, and some mathematical calculations are made to adjust to

20
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:10,110
the frame in this central part of the face.

21
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:19,410
As you can read here, the filter is updated, then from frame four to frame five.

22
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:29,460
The blue filter is updated to this centre position off the face, then in the next frame.

23
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:40,320
This same process is also made now considering that Reds bounding box after finishing the first update

24
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:48,870
of all filters see that this size of the larger filter has decreased slightly.

25
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,130
The green one?

26
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:59,610
See here in the original image that the border is the next should this frame add to the background and

27
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:03,570
here the position is quite different.

28
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:08,700
So it was adjusted to the object when the other side.

29
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:15,960
You can see that the boarding box has been moved here where I am pointing the mouse.

30
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:26,430
The goal of the algorithm is to make several adjustments in these boarding boxes in order to circle

31
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:29,840
the objects and be able to detect it.

32
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:37,890
The larger frames are in part and should detect changes in this scale are the size of the object.

33
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:47,520
For example, if in one frame the object is smaller and in the next frame, the object's increases in

34
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:51,060
size like a person approaching the camera.

35
00:03:51,330 --> 00:04:00,870
Now let's go to the basic understanding of the C SRT algorithm, which means discriminative correlation

36
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:05,040
filter with channel and spatial reliability.

37
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:10,590
It is more accurate than c f, but is is lower.

38
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:16,800
This image shows the steps of the algorithm in the first box.

39
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:21,140
Here we select the object we once should track.

40
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:30,780
For example, only the person's head C or this third batch, which is widely used in computer vision

41
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:35,910
and is related to the information that was selected from the image.

42
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,720
Information about the big cells of the image.

43
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:51,720
Then in this step number two discriminative filter is graded and the hawk a histogram of oriented gradients,

44
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:59,940
that clinic will be used and it will extract the most important information from the image and.

45
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:08,050
Discards everything else, a hog will also identify the edges and corners of the image.

46
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:16,870
Should this cover this shape, for example, the hand is shaped like a Sirico in the third step.

47
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:25,660
A random MERS-CoV test is a blight, which is a mathematical concept to predict the next image.

48
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:34,270
See here that we have the same shape as the image as if it were the person's next movement.

49
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:41,080
In this step, probabilities will be generated to indicate the person's movements.

50
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:49,990
For example, if the person turns his face to the other side in this part two here, that's the prediction

51
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:56,440
will be made in order to verify if the movement is off this person.

52
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:00,040
So that's the algorithm continues tracking.

53
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:07,900
Finally, in a staff member for a confidence map is used in the image.

54
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:16,870
We have only the object with a mask, and at the ends we have, the complete object should be tracked,

55
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,000
as you have noticed.

56
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:27,550
This is a more complex algorithm that uses several computer graphics techniques, and the purpose of

57
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:30,790
this lecture is only to present an overview.

58
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:39,400
If you want to know more details, you can read this article for more information in the next lecture.

59
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:42,400
You are going to learn some more algorithms.

60
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:43,440
See you there!
