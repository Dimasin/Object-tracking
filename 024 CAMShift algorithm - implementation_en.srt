00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:07,140
Hello and welcome to this lecture, where we are going to room, they can shift algorithm and as you

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:11,550
can see here, this source code is already implemented.

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:19,710
We are not going to implement it step by step because it's quite similar to the mean shift algorithm.

4
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:29,030
We have a new implant here, impart in them by S and B and all this code is this same.

5
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:30,780
We are meant as before.

6
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:36,390
We need to get the image or the object we want should track.

7
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:47,760
Using this select write function, we extract only the object converts from RG B to H s v.

8
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,440
Then we need to get the histogram and normalize.

9
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:58,260
It's just a reminder that this algorithm is quite similar to the mean shift.

10
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,840
So we need to compare.

11
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:09,780
The histogram of the image are the histogram of the object, which ones should rank with the histogram

12
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:18,630
of each one of the frames that are coming from the webcam inside the while loop, we are accessing the

13
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:25,260
frames that are coming from the webcam we convert, then should the H.

14
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:27,660
S V call her for months.

15
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:35,550
Then we calculate to the probability distribution function using the call back project.

16
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:39,210
See here that we are sending s barometer.

17
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:46,600
The histogram of the object we one should track and also the current frame.

18
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,810
There is one difference here.

19
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,050
Instead of quality means shift.

20
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:58,320
Now we are calling cam shift function and there other parameters are the same.

21
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:00,960
We just have a difference here.

22
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:10,169
Instead of drawing the rectangle using C v 2.2 rectangle as we implemented before, we are getting the

23
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:10,919
points.

24
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:20,190
Using chalk blocks, points that are the positions of the building blocks we are converting, showing

25
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:29,010
bigger numbers, using them by and we are using poly lines function from open C v and we are creating

26
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:33,900
a new image to draw the building blocks around the object.

27
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:40,740
If you want to know more details about the dysfunction, you can follow this link here from the Open

28
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,210
Sea View documentation.

29
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:44,470
Now, let's run this code.

30
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,760
The process is the same.

31
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:55,920
First, we need to select the building blocks and we will draw a very small bounding box here.

32
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,510
Press Enter.

33
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:06,340
And we can see that this size of the bounding box is bigger than the one, we defined that first.

34
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,420
Because this algorithm is dynamic.

35
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:17,670
So the building blocks will increase and decrease this size, according to the positioning of the object.

36
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:26,340
If the object are far close to the camera, see that the size of the building blocks has increased a

37
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:26,850
little.

38
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:34,950
When the object is far from the camera and when the object is close to the camera, the bounding box

39
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:36,660
is a little bit smaller.

40
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:44,610
And this algorithm has the same problem as the other one when we move the object very quick.

41
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:52,530
It loses the building blocks, so you need to perform some tests with the parameters according to the

42
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:56,100
type of video that you are working with.

43
00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:03,630
And in the next lecture, you are going to learn the intuition about order track key algorithm.

44
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:04,770
So you know.
