00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:07,680
Hello and welcome to this lecture, where you are going to learn the basic intuition about the Meaning

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:17,370
Shift algorithm, which uses space analysis to find the maximum off adding city function.

3
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,770
They both texts here are the main concepts of the algorithm.

4
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:27,210
And now let's understand how it basically works.

5
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:38,280
It determines the weight of nearby points are big cells based on average calculation using crawlers.

6
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:47,550
Let's suppose that in this animation, there are four big cells one, two, three and four, and you

7
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:50,190
select these white peaks.

8
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:51,810
So here's a Two-track.

9
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,640
So the algorithm will move towards these white peaks.

10
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:07,830
So as you can see, the pixels are moved until they reach this area here where you once should track.

11
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:14,710
This is the thing, said the function when the number of peak cells is greater.

12
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:23,610
It is basically an approximation of the peak cells, according to the features of the initial object.

13
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:35,130
This other image shows another example where you can see the arrow moving towards these white bar here,

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,210
which might be what one should track.

15
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,600
So this is the density function.

16
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:52,890
There is another representation of the algorithm that are a set of points on the left side, and some

17
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:55,560
windows are circles here.

18
00:01:55,830 --> 00:02:00,750
These three points, the algorithm needs to move.

19
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:09,330
These windows are circles should these areas here where I am pointing the mouse.

20
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:17,280
The algorithm will approximate this Reds peak sales trapeze image.

21
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:26,850
In other words, we are going to move to the area of maximal pixel density where there are more pixels

22
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:29,730
than in other parts of the image.

23
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:37,110
It will be moved should these red bars at the top where the density is higher.

24
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:46,470
Below we have the representation with these three bars and this is the biggest because there are more

25
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:47,610
pixels here.

26
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:57,780
Let's count, for example, one two three four five six seven pixels, so the bar is higher than the

27
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:04,710
others in this one one two three four five six pixels.

28
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:09,240
So the bar is smaller than this one here.

29
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:15,510
And finally, in this point here, there are only one big so.

30
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,140
So the bar is is smaller than the others.

31
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:29,430
So this is the density function that counts the number of pixels in each one of these windows here.

32
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:35,910
The size of the bars indicates the density, as you can read here.

33
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:47,370
The data point density The goal is to bring these points closer to these image, which is equivalent

34
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:57,120
should these one above and the ladders beat the f stand for probability density function, which is

35
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,990
the mathematical calculation used in mean shift.

36
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:12,780
We can consider this image here as the current frame of the video and this image here as the next frame,

37
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:23,460
a confidence map based on probabilities will be created to approximate the frames so that the algorithm

38
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:27,690
can identify where the target object is.

39
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:39,270
Larger bars here are related to greater probabilities, while smaller bars indicate less probability

40
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,380
of the object being in this position here.

41
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:50,490
In short, the object one should track is in this central part.

42
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,990
Where did things sit?

43
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:55,230
The R number of pixels cells is greater.

44
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,310
This or other animation shows how the upper.

45
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:04,090
Summation works that are more pixels in the center.

46
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:09,590
And the algorithm goes here where the object is located.

47
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:17,650
This is the basic intuition about missing shift and in the next lecture where we start the implementations.

48
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:18,680
See you there!
